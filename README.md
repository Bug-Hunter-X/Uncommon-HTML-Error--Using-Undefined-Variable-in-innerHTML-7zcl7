# Uncommon HTML Error: Undefined Variable in innerHTML

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in HTML that can be tricky to debug.  The error occurs when attempting to assign an undefined JavaScript variable to the innerHTML property of an HTML element.  This will not throw a JavaScript error, but the expected output is not rendered.

The `bug.html` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.html` provides a corrected version.
